<h1>Wordle Helper - C</h1>

<p>This is a small C application I built to assist in making the most effective guesses in Wordle. This project was inspired by the sheer domination I was facing trying to compete with someone in the daily Wordle.</p>

<p><i>To use run the Wordle helper</i>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the command 'make re' (This creates the executable)</li>
<li>Use the wordle helper</li>
<li>Run the executable ('./wordle-solver')</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, if you see any issues with my code or think I could improve it (whether it be in regards to time or space complexity, or anything at all), please let me know! (Probably by forking my repo and putting your own solution up with comments for me to see).</p>
